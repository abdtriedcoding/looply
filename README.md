# Looply

The Open-Source Platform for Team Collaboration & Project Management

## What is Looply?

**Looply** is an open-source productivity suite for modern teams. It combines messaging (Slack-like), task management (Trello/Linear-like), docs (Notion-like), and collaboration tools into one unified workspace. Built for teams that want full control, customization, and ownership over their stack.

## Why Looply?

Modern work is broken.

You get a Slack message linking to a Confluence doc to prep for a Zoom meeting.  
You take notes in Notion, update progress in Monday, and move tasks in Trello.  
By the end of the week, you‚Äôve just shuffled the same info across 10 apps ‚Äî and paid $15/user for each one.

**Looply** fixes this mess:

- ‚úÖ One tool for messaging, tasks, docs, and collaboration  
- üí∏ Open-source, self-hosted, no $15/user SaaS traps  
- üß† All-in-one, so teams can focus on real work ‚Äî not switching tabs  

## Tech Stack

Looply is built with modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
